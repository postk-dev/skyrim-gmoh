A Wabbajak modlist for Skyrim SE

# Brief

<p>
    This is the beta version of a Wabbajak modlist for Skyrim SE. If you are new to Wabbajack, Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) or
    Skyrim modding, I recommend starting with an official Wabbajak modlist (https://www.wabbajack.org).
</p>
<p>
    This list has 3 goals:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Completely overhaul Skyrim. This includes, but is not limited to, the landscape, UI and core gameplay systems.
    </li>
    <li>Give your Dragonborn character more roleplay choices.</li>
    <li>Build a comprehensive modlist that players can use to start modding Skyrim to their tastes.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Gameplay balance is a far-flung goal of this list. Curently, you will likely feel slightly underpowered at lower
    levels and overpowered at higher levels.
</p>

# Requirements

<ul>
    <li>The Steam version of Skyrim: Special Edition. Only English is supported.</li>
    <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade">The
            Anniversary Edition content.</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">C++ Redistributable for VS2019</a></li>
    <li>1 Terabyte of fast storage (preferably SSD). This can be distributed across 2 drives.</li>
    <li>For a stable experience, at least 16GB of RAM and 12GB of VRAM.</li>
</ul>

# Disclaimer

    <li>The list is in beta. You may experience breaking issues during installation or during gameplay.</li>
    <li>Please plan for the installation process to take significant time and bandwidth.</li>
    <li>This is not a performance friendly list. Expect framerate drops in busy areas.</li>
    <li><strong>Please do not report bugs/issues to individual mod authors</strong>. Issues must be reported through the

# Installation Steps
<ul>
    <li>Verify the integrity of your Skyrim installation <a
            href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB">https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB</a>.
    </li>
    <li>Download wabbajak.exe from the <a href="www.wabbajak.org">official Wabbajak site</a>.</li>
    <li>Download the latest Wabbajak .meta file for GMOH from the <a
            href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106393">Nexus mod page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wabbajak Installation & Configuration</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Create a new folder for the Wabbajak application somewhere close to the root of your drive (e.g. c:\wabbajak).
        <em>Do not create this folder in a
            UAC protected folder (e.g. Program Files or My Games)</em>.
    </li>
    <li>Move wabbajak.exe into the new folder.</li>
    <li>Run the executable and wait for it to update.</li>
    <li>Select "Install from Disk".</li>
    <li>Here you will be asked to configure some file paths:
        <dl>
            <dt>"Target Modlist"</dt>
            <dd>The path to the .meta file you downloaded in the previous step.</dd>
            <dt>"Installation Location"</dt>
            <dd>This folder will contain the portable Mod Organizer 2 instance. I recommend "c:\gmoh", or something
                similar.</dd>
            <dd></dd>
            <dd><em>This folder must be located on the same drive as your Skyrim installation. Like the Wabbajak folder,
                    it can not be placed in a UAC protected folder.</em></sub></dd>
            <dt>"Download Location"</dt>
            <dd>This folder will contain all of the downloaded archive files required for the installation process. By
                default, it will
                be placed in the Mod Organizer 2 folder. If storage space is a concern, it is okay to create this folder
                on a separate
                drive.</dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the play button to start the download and installation process.
    </li>
</ol>

# Starting a New Game
<ul>
    <li>Please unplug or power off your gamepad while playing. Leaving it on can lead to UI/gameplay issues.</li>
    <li>After creating your character, you will find yourself in the realm of Lorkhan. If you would like, explore the
        area and
        find ways to further customize your character. You can always come back later.</li>
    <li>Interact with the purple shards to leave Lorkhan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shadow of Skyrim</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65136">Shadow of Skyrim</a> can provide an alternative
    to player death in Skyrim. To use it, you will need to turn it on in the
    MCM. This can be done at any time.</p>
<p>If you happen to stumble on another means of circumventing death (e.g. a perk, spell or item), you will need to
    remember to deactivate the mod.</p>

# Controls
Modded keybinds can be changed via the mod configuration menu (MCM) or INI file as indicated by the third column. Other
keybinds can be changed in Skyrim's keybind menu.

# Known issues
<a href="https://github.com/postk-dev/skyrim-gmoh/blob/main/Known-Issues.md">Here.</a>

# Reporting a bug | CTD
<ul>
    <li>I will be unable to provide support if you have made modifications to any part of the list.</li>
    <li>Please refer to known issues before reporting a bug.</li>
    <li>Please report bugs on the Discord.</li>
    <li>When reporting a crash to desktop (CTD), it must be reasonable to reproduce and include a log file. If the
        report does
        not meet this requirement, it will likely be ignored. Your crash logs can be found in the user folder
        "Documents\My
        Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE". It should look like this: "crash-[datetime of crash].log". Please do not
        copy paste
        text from the log file into a report, just attach the file.</li>
</ul>

# Tips
<ul>
    <li>
        Skyrim's engine has some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJPzMAXSprU">known issues</a> with
        reloading during play.
        Consider relaunching the game instead of reloading a save. If you are dying alot, consider enabling Shadow of
        Skyrim.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid saving during combat as there tends to be more scripts running at that time. This can help alleviate save
        corruption.
    </li>
</ul>

# FAQ

<p><strong>Q: I lost my follower. How can I find them again?</strong></p>
<p>A: If they are imported into Nether's follower framework, you should be able to teleport them to you from the
    Follower
    Framework MCM. If they are exempt from the framework (e.g. Serana or Lucien), they will typically have
    a
    follower tracker quest or a spell to summon them to you. Failing that, lookup the NPC reference ID on UESP
    (https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:People) or use Google, open the game console -> "prid {referenceId}" -> "moveto
    player". Keep in mind there are some quests/areas that deliberately seperate you from your followers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I can't seem to progress the main quest. Did something change?</strong></p>
<p>A: At Your Own Pace (https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704) makes modifications to many of the
    main
    quest lines in Skyrim. Check the mod page for info on how you can progress. Failing that, ask in the Discord.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why is my stamina bar going up when I hit an enemy?</strong></p>
<p>A: Have a look at the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741">Valhalla Combat mod
        page</a> to
    see how
    the combat system has changed.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where are the screenshots I took in photo mode?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can find the .png files in the stock game folder. There is also .dds texture files located in the overwrite
    folder (located at the very bottom of the modlist in Mod Organizer).</p>
<p><strong>
        Q: How do I reload the original Immersive Equipment Display preset that came with the list?
    </strong></p>
<p>
    A: Open IED (shift + F1) -> File tab (top left) -> Default Config -> Import.
</p>
<p><strong>
        Q: The physics on this hair and/or outfit is acting strange. How do I fix it?
    </strong></p>
<p>
    A: Open the console -> type "smp reset"
</p>
<p><strong>Q: Wtf is GMOH?
    </strong></p>
<p>
    A: Giga modlist (of hell).
