A Wabbajak modlist for Skyrim SE

# Brief

<p>
    This is the beta version of a Wabbajak modlist for Skyrim SE. If you are new to Wabbajack, Mod Organizer 2 (MO2) or
    Skyrim modding, I recommend starting with an official Wabbajak modlist (https://www.wabbajack.org).
</p>
<p>
    This list has two goals:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Completely overhaul Skyrim. This includes, but is not limited to, the landscape, UI and core gameplay systems.
    </li>
    <li>Massively expand on the roleplay options available to the Dragonborn character.</li>
</ol>

# Requirements

<ul>
    <li>The Steam version of Skyrim: Special Edition. <strong>English is currently the only supported language.</strong>
    </li>
    <li><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1746860/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Anniversary_Upgrade">The
            Anniversary Edition content.</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe">C++ Redistributable for VS2019</a></li>
    <li>1 Terabyte of fast storage (preferably SSD). Some of this can be distributed across 2 drives.</li>
    <li>For a stable experience, at least 16GB of RAM and 8-16GB of VRAM.</li>
</ul>

# Disclaimer

<ul>
    <li>The list is in beta. You may experience breaking issues during installation or gameplay.</li>
    <li><strong style="font-size: x-large; background-color:crimson;">Please do not report any bugs/issues to individual mod authors</strong>. Issues must be reported through the
        support channels
        provided. More info <a href="#reporting-a-bug--ctd">here</a>.</li>
    <li>Please plan for the installation process to take significant time (several hours) and bandwidth (~500GB).</li>
    <li>If you <strong>do not</strong> have a Nexus premium account, the installer will require you to click on a
        download link for <strong>every mod hosted on Nexus (~2700)</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>This is not a performance friendly list.</strong> Expect longer load times and framerate drops in
        visually busy areas.</li>
</ul>

# Installation Steps
<ul>
    <li>Verify the integrity of your Skyrim installation (<a
            href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/0C48-FCBD-DA71-93EB">Steam support - Verify Integrity of
            Game Files</a>).
    </li>
    <li>Download wabbajak.exe from the <a href="www.wabbajak.org">official Wabbajak site</a>.</li>
    <li>Download the latest Wabbajak .meta file for GMOH from the <a
            href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/106393">Nexus mod page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wabbajak Installation & Configuration</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<ol>
    <li>Create a new folder for the Wabbajak application somewhere close to the root of your drive (e.g. c:\wabbajak).
        <em>Do not create this folder in a
            UAC protected folder (e.g. Program Files or My Games)</em>.
    </li>
    <li>Move wabbajak.exe into the new folder.</li>
    <li>Run the executable and wait for it to update.</li>
    <li>Select "Install from Disk".</li>
    <li>Here, you will be asked to configure some file paths:
        <dl>
            <dt>"Target Modlist"</dt>
            <dd>The path to the .meta file you downloaded in the previous step.</dd>
            <dt>"Installation Location"</dt>
            <dd>This folder will contain the portable Mod Organizer 2 instance. I recommend "c:\gmoh", or something
                similar.</dd>
            <dd></dd>
            <dd><em>This folder must be located on the same drive as your Skyrim installation. Like the Wabbajak folder,
                    it can not be placed in a UAC protected folder.</em></sub></dd>
            <dt>"Download Location"</dt>
            <dd>This folder will contain all of the downloaded archive files required for the installation process. By
                default, it will
                be placed in the Mod Organizer 2 folder. If storage space is a concern, it is okay to create this folder
                on a separate
                drive.</dd>
        </dl>
    </li>
    <li>
        Click the play button to start the download and installation process.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Expect this process to take several hours to complete. The length of time is highly dependant on your
                internet speed, internal storage speed and if you have a Nexus premium account.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the process is interrupted for any reason, simply reopen Wabbajack and click the play button to pick
                up where you left off.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        Once the installation is complete, you can open MO2 (modorganizer.exe) from your installation directory.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Additional Configuration (optional)</h3>
<p>Look for the mmods under the "Your Preference" seperator in MO2 (near the bottom of the list).</p>
<p><strong>Skyrim Upscaler</strong> - I recommend enabling this mod if you have a GPU that supports DLAA. Other
    upscaling techniques do not currently work with the ENB plugin.</p>
<p><strong>JS Unlock Everything</strong> - This mod allows you to skip all lockpicking minigames.</p>

# Starting a New Game
<ul>
    <li>In MO2, make sure SKSE is the selected program and click "Run".</li>
    <li>Please unplug or power off your gamepad while playing. Leaving it on can lead to UI/gameplay issues.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Realm of Lorkhan</h3>
<ul>
    <li>After creating your character, you will find yourself in the realm of Lorkhan. If you would like, explore the
        area and
        find ways to further customize your character. You can always come back later.</li>
    <li>Interact with the purple shards to leave Lorkhan.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Shadow of Skyrim (optional)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65136">Shadow of Skyrim</a> can provide an alternative
    to player death in Skyrim. To use it, you will need to turn it on in the
    MCM. This can be done at any time.</p>
<p><em>If you happen to stumble on another means of circumventing death (e.g. a perk, spell or item), you will need to
        remember to deactivate this mod.</em></p>
<h3>Immersive Hunting Animations (optional)</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96961">Immersive Hunting Animations</a> adds
    (immersive) animations to the loot interactions on animals. The animations are off by default and will need to be
    activated in the "Immersive Hunting" MCM.</p>

# Controls
Modded keybinds can be changed via the mod configuration menu (MCM) or via an INI file.

# Known issues
<a href="https://github.com/postk-dev/skyrim-gmoh/blob/main/Known-Issues.md">Here.</a>

# Reporting a bug | CTDs
<ul>
    <li>I will be unable to provide support if you have made modifications to any part of the list.</li>
    <li>Please use the Discord to report bugs and view known issues/solutions.</li>
    <li>A crash (CTD) report must:
        <ol>
            <li>Be reproducible.<br /><em>i.e. You can get the game to crash consistently in the same location or when
                    taking
                    certain actions.</em>
            </li>
            <li>Be reasonable to reproduce.</li>
            <li>Include steps to reproduce.</li>
            <li>Include a crash log file.<p><em>Your crash logs can be found in the
                        user folder "Documents\My
                        Games\Skyrim Special Edition\SKSE". The date and time of the crash will be indicated by the
                        filename (e.g.
                        "crash-[datetime of crash].log").</em></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>If the report does not meet this requirement, it will likely be ignored</strong>. Not because I want
            to, but there will be very little I can do if I can't reproduce it on my end.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

# Common Issues & Resolutions
<h3>Keeping your Playthrough Alive</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Skyrim's engine has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJPzMAXSprU">issues</a> with
        reloading a save during play.
        Consider relaunching the game instead of reloading a save. If you are dying alot, consider enabling Shadow of
        Skyrim.
    </li>
    <li>
        Avoid saving during combat as there tends to be more scripts running at that time. This can help alleviate save
        corruption.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Gameplay Issues</h3>
<p><strong>How can I find lost followers?</strong></p>
<p>If they are imported into Nether's follower framework, you should be able to teleport them to you from the
    Follower
    Framework MCM. If they are exempt from the framework (e.g. Serana or Lucien), they will typically have
    a
    follower tracker quest or a spell to summon them to you. Failing that, lookup the NPC on UESP
    (https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:People) or use Google to find their reference ID. Then, open the game console ->
    "prid {referenceId}" -> "moveto
    player". Keep in mind there are some quests/areas that deliberately seperate you from your followers.</p>
<p><strong>I am stuck and don't know how to progress a main story quest.</strong></p>
<p>At Your Own Pace makes changes to many of the main
    quest lines in Skyrim. Check the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52704">mod page</a>
    for info on how you can progress. Failing that, ask in the Discord.</p>
<p><strong>Why does my stamina bar go up when I hit an enemy?</strong></p>
<p>See the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741">Valhalla Combat mod
        page</a> to
    understand how
    the combat system has changed.</p>
<p><strong>The loot (QuickLoot) menu isn't showing up.</strong>
</p>
<p>It should come back when you are out of combat. This can be configured in the QuickLootRE .toml file (..\Custom Mod
    Config\SKSE\Plugins\QuickLootRE)</p>
<p><strong>I am having a hard time with certain bosses.</strong></p>
<p>Difficulty on some bosses comes from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18183">Real
        Bosses - Light</a>. There are some tips on the mod page for harder encounters.</p>
<p><strong>My character covered in dirt/blood/grime.</strong></p>
<p>Go for a swim, take a bath or hope for some rain to wash it off.</p>
<p><strong>How do I reload the original Immersive Equipment Display preset that came with the list?</strong></p>
<p>Open IED (<kbd>Shift + F1</kbd>) -> File tab (top left) -> Default Config -> Import -> Overwrite everything.</p>
<p><strong>Where are the screenshots I took in photo mode?</strong></p>
<p>"My Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition/Photos"</p>
<p><strong>How do I fix SMP issues (clipping outfit/hair)?</strong></p>
<p>Open the console -> type "smp reset". Going through a load screen should also reset it.</p>
<h3>Technical Issues</h3>
<p><strong>Can anything be done to improve my framerate?</strong></p>
<p>Removing NAT III, Rudy ENB for NAT III and any of their dependencies should substantially improve your framerate.
    <em>Keep in mind that doing so will void any support I can provide</em>.
</p>
<p>If you are looking for a performance friendly replacement, I recommend Azurite Weathers and PI-CHO ENB.</p>

<p><strong>What do I do if my game crashes (CTD) or I encounter a bug?</strong></p>
<p>Please see <a href="#reporting-a-bug--ctd">reporting a bug/CTD</a>.</p>
<p><strong>SSEEdit/Synthesis/Nemesis/Dyndolod/TexGen crashing or won't finish processing.</strong></p>
<p>Try each of the
    following:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Restart Mod Organizer.</li>
    <li>Restart your PC.</li>
    <li>(You may need Google's help here...) Temporarily disable your anti-virus software and Windows real-time threat
        protection. If that resolves the issue,
        consider adding an exception for the executable.</li>
