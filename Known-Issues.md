# Known Issues

- Long load/startup times and Mod Organizer 2 responsiveness.
    Loading to the main menu will take some time (expect to measure in minutes). Speed/responsiveness may improve as more mods are moved to BSA format.
- Cluttered crafting menu.
    Please make use of SkyUI's sorting/filtering options.
- Item distribution and leveled lists issues.
    If you encounter a bug (i.e. an NPC has 3 of the same weapon), please let me know. I am not as concerned with players encountering loot that is powerful for their level. 
- Neck seams or strange looking characters during character creation.
    Make sure to select a high poly head under face part options.
    If you are using a preset, check the sculpt tab in RaceMenu to see if the preset has a head morph preset.
- Holes or seams in the landscape.
    There are likely a few. I may have made a mistake in the load order and/or something needs a patch. If you find one, please report a bug with a screenshot and the form ID of the cell.
- Too much grass.
    No plans to patch any grass. You might see improvements over time as the load order changes.
- My follower thinks we're married.
    If you are seeing innapropriate dialogue options for a follower (you see spouse dialogue when you are not married, for example), use the console to manually modify the relationship rank (see: setrelationshiprank https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Console).
- Some soft incompatabilities between followers that have dialogue/reactions to main quests and mods that modify the main quests.
    No plans to address this.
- Full gamepad support not yet implemented.
    Be sure to disconnect your gamepad during play to avoid issues.
- Bruma road textures don't integrate well with landscape.
    I will try to address this at some point.
- Sometimes NPCs are missing their clothes when I load into an area.
    Open console -> Click the NPC -> toggle them using "disable" and then "enable" commands. If that doesn't work, try using the "resetinventory" command (be VERY careful using this on followers if you have given them stuff to hold).
- CTD related to character skeletons.
    These crashes happen occasionally and I don't believe they can be reliably reproduced. Crash logs and feedback on this are appreciated.
- Incompatabilities with Experience.
